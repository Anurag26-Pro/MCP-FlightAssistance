# MCP-Flight Assistance  
The MCP allows you to build servers that expose data and functionality to the LLM application in a secure, standardized way. This is similar to an API call but specifically designed for LLM models.  

# Use Case Description  
1. MCP-Flight Assistance is a use case that helps airline passengers get accurate information about their flights.  
2. Weatherstack and AviationStack APIs are used in this use case.  
3. This use case is built using the MCP Architecture.  
4. For designing this use case, Cursor IDE is used. Cursor can send requests to the server seamlessly.  
5. In this use case, Cursor is the client that sends requests to the server/tool.  
6. In MCP, the tool enables the server to expose executable functionality to the client.
